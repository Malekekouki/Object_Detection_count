# Object_Detection_count

## Overview

This project utilizes a pre-trained model based on SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) with MobileNetV2 for object detection and counting. The purpose of the model is to identify and count objects within images, videos, and webcam feeds.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

1. **MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt**: Configuration file for the MobileNetSSD model.
2. **MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel**: Pre-trained weights for the MobileNetSSD model.

These files are essential for the proper functioning of the object detection system.

The document comprises three sections: the first focuses on object detection and counting using an image, the second on object detection and counting using a video, and the last on object detection with a webcam.
